# Consensus Mechanism in Qublis

## Overview

The consensus mechanism in Qublis is a hybrid system that leverages both classical and quantum algorithms to ensure the security, efficiency, and scalability of the blockchain. Unlike traditional blockchain systems, Qublis uses quantum entanglement and quantum-resistant algorithms to secure the network and maintain integrity.

### Hybrid Consensus Model

1. **Classical Consensus**: A classical consensus algorithm (e.g., Proof of Stake, Proof of Work) is used for general network participation and block validation.
2. **Quantum Consensus**: Quantum algorithms are integrated into the process to optimize the consensus, allowing nodes to reach an agreement faster and more securely through quantum entanglement. The goal is to ensure that the network is resistant to quantum attacks and can scale with increasing computational power.

### Steps in the Consensus Process

1. **Block Proposal**: A validator proposes a new block, which includes a list of transactions. The block is sent to other nodes for verification.
2. **Quantum Entanglement Verification**: The network performs quantum entanglement checks to ensure that the proposed block meets the consensus criteria. This step uses quantum feedback loops to optimize the decision-making process.
3. **Block Validation**: Once the quantum verification is complete, nodes validate the block using classical consensus algorithms (such as Proof of Stake). The block is added to the blockchain once validated by a sufficient number of nodes.
4. **Quantum Feedback**: Post-consensus, quantum algorithms run to optimize resource allocation for the next round of consensus and transaction processing.

### Benefits

- **Increased Speed**: The hybrid approach allows for faster consensus decisions by leveraging quantum speed-ups in decision-making.
- **Enhanced Security**: The quantum consensus layer provides additional security against quantum-enabled attacks that could otherwise compromise traditional blockchain systems.
- **Scalability**: The quantum-enhanced consensus model allows for scalable network growth, handling larger volumes of transactions and nodes without compromising performance.

### Quantum Consensus Example

1. A block proposal is sent to all nodes.
2. Quantum algorithms check entanglement properties of the block to ensure no malicious behavior is involved.
3. After quantum checks, nodes use classical consensus to finalize the block.
4. The finalized block is added to the chain, and quantum feedback is used to improve the next round of decision-making.
